# Tag Usage and Development

The form item rendering and interaction events are based on pre-defined Tag components. A Tag component can be think of as a kind of encapsulated form  (e.g. input, textarea, table, upload, etc.). It facilitates the development and use of standard plugins by adding attributes and methods to native form element or specific business component. A standard plugin generally contains one or more Tag components. The frontend page loads standard plugin configuration file, reads the type field of each form item and renders the corresponding type of form.

# Standard plugin rendering logic

The rendering of standard plugin form items is distributed by RenderForm component. RenderForm component is based on Vue encapsulation, it uses the two-way data binding feature of Vue and realizes the v-model instruction for component form item value. When calling a component, feed the corresponding configuration item props to achieve automatic data sync between parent component and RenderForm internal component.

Each form item configuration in the configuration file corresponds to a FormItem component in the rendering layer of frontend component. Generally speaking (when not selected), the FormItem component contains a Tag* subcomponent. The type of the Tag is defined by the type field in the configuration item. Currently supported types include: input, textarea, checkbox, radio, select, table, upload, tree, password, etc. All Tag component has some pre-defined public attribute or methods. If a certain Tag type needs to support a specific event or function, it should be defined in the corresponding Tag subcomponent. If the official Tags do not meet the demands of custom-developed plugins, you can also develop new tags in accordance with the specifications.

The rendering process of standard plugin form:

![Image Description](../resource/img/renderform_flow.png)

formMixins function defines some public attributes and methods for Tag component. This method is called to mix in when adding Tag component to avoid writing repeated declarations.

Public attributes are divided into inherited attributes and non-inherited attributes. Inherited attributes are defined as props attribute in Tag component. Currently, value is the only inherited attribute. Non-inherited attributes are converted to data attribute. Its value will not update dynamically. The value defined in the configuration file of standard plugin will be used for the attribute first. If the configuration item does not contain the corresponding attribute, then default value will be used.

The private attributes of a Tag component are defined when the component is added. The value defined in the configuration file of standard plugin will be used for the attribute first. If the configuration item does not contain the corresponding attribute, then default value will be used.

# Tag Usage

Using Tag component is very simple. Define `type` field in standard plugin configuration item, add the attributes and methods supported by this type of Tag, and the corresponding form item will be rendered in the frontend page. By combining different Tag components, one can create complex interactive forms.

Currently, SOPS has the following Tag components built-in:

- button
- cascader
- checkbox
- datatable
- datetime
- time
- input
- int
- ipSelector
- password
- radio
- select
- text
- textarea
- tree
- upload
- memberSelector
- setAllocation
- TagSection
- codeEditor
# Tag component attribute and method

When the configuration items defined by standard plugin are rendered in the page, they will be passed on to Tag components as attributes. Tage component can expand a variety of form configurations based on different attribute values. For example, `TagSelect` component can use `multiple` attribute to define whether a drop-down box is multi-select or single-select. `TagUpload` component can use `remote_data_init` attribute to customize the processing logic after loading the data.

When different standard plugins are rendered on the frontend page, there are some public interaction logics, including form item name, hidden status, hookability, validation rules, etc. These are public attributes, and all Tag components support standard plugin custom configuration. Since different Tags have their own application scenarios, they have different types of native forms or specific business scenarios encapsulated in the components, and the attributes they support are also different. Only certain tag components support standard plug-ins. Some attributes only support standard plugin custom configuration in specific Tag component, such attributes are called private attributes, such as the `remote_data_init` attribute in the `TagUpload` component.

To improve the capabilities of standard plugin, Tag components have encapsulated some public methods, which can be called in the event callback of standard plugin configuration item, such as hide form, acquire parent form component, acquire current form value, etc.

**The form item attributes and methods defined in the configuration file can only be retrieved by the component if they have been declared in the Tag component. **

## Public attributes

- `name`: the name of the form item, which controls the display of the label on the page
- `hookable`: whether it can be hooked as a global variable
- `validation`: the validation rules for form items. There are three types of form validation: `required`, `regex`, and `custom`. They should be used according to your needs:
```js
    {
      // ...
      validation: [
        { type: 'required' },
        {
          type: 'regex',
          args: RegExp, //Example: /\d{3}/
          error_message: String //Example: 'Please enter 3 numbers'
        },
        {
          type: 'custom',
          args (value, parentValue) {
            //...
            return { //The validation method must return the following format object
              result: Boolean,
              error_message: String
            }
          }
        },
      ]
    }
```
- `default`: the default value of the form item. Different Tag components support different data types.
- `hidden`: whether it is hidden by default
- `formViewHidden`: whether the form is hidden in view mode
- `col`: the number of horizontal columns, 12 maximum. Multiple forms can be laid out horizontally after this attribute is set.
- `value`: the value of form component. It needs to be manually defined in the Tag and passed on as a parameter for calling `getFormMixins` function.

## Public methods

- `updateForm`: trigger `change` event, update form value and call validation function. The parameter is `value`
- `validate`: validation function
- `show`: hide form
- `hide`: show form
- `get_form_instance`: get form instance, FormItem
- `get_parent`: get combine instance or root element instance
- `get_child`: get form instance. The parameter is tag_code in sub-form. It supports calling RenderForm or RenderGroup components
- `get_value`: get form value. It supports a Boolean parameter to be passed from configuration. The value is set to false by default. If the passed parameter's value is true, when tag form is hooked as a global variable, the corresponding value of global variable can be acquired.
-`get_tag_value`: get any form value of the current standard plugin. The parameter `path` is the path of the target tag form. The form value search starts from the outermost layer of the standard plug-in, such as `['bk_receiver_info','bk_more_receiver']`
- `set_value`: set the form value. The parameter is form value.

# Methods defined in standard plugin

When the Tag component is being initialized and rendered, the methods in the methods attribute of the corresponding configuration item will be registered to the Tag component, and the standard plugin can add methods according to demands.

If the standard plugin needs to perform some initialization logic when the Tag component is rendered for the first time, you can define `_tag_init` method in the `methods` attribute, which will be executed by default when the component is mounted on the page.


# Event interactions between Tag components

The Tag components implement event interaction between components by publish/subscribe. For example, in the TagSelect component, after selecting a data item, the value is updated to the TagInput of the same hierarchy. When the frontend renders the component, it registers the defined event listeners according to the source + type rules configured in the events attribute of the standard plugin. Other components can call `this.$emit(${tagcode}_${event_type})` to trigger the event listener callback for the corresponding form.

The event interaction between Tag components is relatively simple. You just need to define the events rule in the standard plugin form item to listen to the events dispatched by the corresponding form, for example:

```js
  tag_code: 'biz_input',
  type: 'input',
  attrs: {
    name: 'some label'
  },
  events: [
    {
      source: "biz_info",
      type: "change",
      action: function () {
          const bizInfo = this.get_parent().get_child('biz_info')
          const value = bizInfo._get_value()
          this.updateForm(value)
      }
    }
  ]
```

The `biz_input` form item listens to the `biz_info` form item value change event, and updates its selected value to the input.

**Tag component throws init event by default when the frontend is initializing rendering (the `_tag_init` method defined in the methods configuration item of the standard plugin is executed before the init event is thrown)**

**Tips**

- Every Tag component will trigger `init` event by default when it is rendered to the frontend page. The standard plugin form item can listen to this event according to demands.
- Every Tag component will trigger `change` event by default when the form value changes. The standard plugin form item can listen to this event according to demands.
- Tag components only support event interactions in the same hierarchy level (same parent component), which corresponds to the same level form item in standard plugin configuration item or the same level form item in combine.


# Tag Development

## Custom tag development process

To add a Tag component, just add a single vue component file in the `src/components/tags/` directory of the frontend project. The file name format is `Tagxxx`, `xxx` being the name of the Tag component. The name should follow camel case rule and should be unique among all `Tags` in the project. webpack will search for files in this directory when packaging, and automatically load and register them to the `FormItem` component. It is recommended to add a `tag-xxx` `class` name to the outermost element of the template, where `xxx` being the name of the Tag.

When writing components, please keep the following points in mind:

- Display mode and edit state
  
  RenderForm component is a universal component, it is used for rendering all standard plugin forms on the pages of SOPS. Different locations of the page may have different states and modes, such as edit state, disable state, form mode, view mode. Therefore, when writing component templates, different templates are required for different scenarios. Use `formEdit` attribute to distinguish edit from disabled state. Use `formMode` attribute to distinguish form mode from view mode.

- Define private attributes. Mix in public attributes and methods.

  When writing components, you must introduce public attributes and methods. After defining private attributes, call public mixins function to pass in parameters. Private attributes must contain the value attributes. Attribute declaration should follow the format in props validation rules. mixins function is defined by the `src/components/common/RenderForm/formMixins.js` file in frontend project directory. 

- Form value binding

  Two-way binding must be implemented for Tag component values. Use a computed attribute to handle binding logic. The `get` in computed attribute is the value in the props (note that deep copy is used for reference type value), `set` needs to call the `updateForm` method to pass in the modified value to the component, triggering the change event and validation logic.
