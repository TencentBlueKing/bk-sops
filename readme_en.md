Standard OPS is a product in the Tencent Blueking product system, designed to arrange task process and execution
 through a visual graphical interface.

Standard OPS provides two core services. One is scheduling arrangement service: based on the capability of The BlueKing
 PaaS API Gateway to connect various system APIs of an enterprise, integrate the works among multiple systems within 
 the enterprise into a task flow, so as to achieve one-key automated scheduling.The other is self-service: Standard OPS
 shields the difference of the underlying system, allowing the operation and maintenance personnel to hand over the 
 daily operation and maintenance of the business to the personnel of the product, development, test, etc., to realize
 the self-service of the release and change of the business. By means of in-depth integration with BlueKing PaaS,
 Standard OPS provides users with “Min-APP” and “Functional Center”, so that we can further reduce the user's operating
 costs and increase the self-service rate.

The background uses Python as the development language and Django development framework. The front end uses Vue to
 develop the page, uses jQuery to develop the Standard Plugins, and through the configuration development mode, it
 greatly reduces the difficulty for users to develop front-end forms of Standard Plugins.
