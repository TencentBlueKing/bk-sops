# V3.28.0 Release Notes

[ **Important** ]  Failure retry are no longer allowed to change the node settings  temporarily, Only task-level input parameters are allowed to change.

Notes :

```
1. When you execue a task, the only way for the executor to interact with the task is using input parameters. Like executing a program, the executor just can pass parameters as requested by the program provider, but cannot change  the source code. Modifying the node settings in the middle of a task is like changing the source code, which is not allowable. Node settings can only be modified by the manager of the flow during the coding phase.

2. In a scenario where the process manager authorizes a helper team to execute, allowing the execution to modify the node settings is a dangerous operation. The executor has the permission to modify scripts, IP, etc. which may cause serious consequences.

3. Modifying the node settings in the middle of a task is a temporary action that takes effect once and cannot work for the new tasks. Instead of such an operation, it is better to modify the flow and create a new task.
